XYZ Autos 

This Project is a web app for a dealership XYZ. The main purpose of this app is for customers to view inventory, representatives to add inventory and also for customers to ask for support help for the vehicles that were purchased from XYZ autos. 

I disbled "ABOUT XYZ" and "Testimonial" buttons since they might not be required in this project. The "Our Representatives" button is where the admin adds inventory.  It should have a login but I ran out time. "Inventory" button is where the customers view XYZ current inventory. "Support" button is a chatroom like Piazza where customers share there expriences and ask for support with their cars.
